    description:
      "This Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) facilitates the installation of a seat belt in the center of the rear bench seat of a Cessna 182 aircraft. By creating a third seat position in the rear bench seat, the STC enables seating for three children, effectively transforming the C182 into a five-occupant aircraft.",
    limitations:
      "The STC imposes weight restrictions, permitting a maximum weight of 100 lbs for the center occupant and 120 lbs each for the outboard occupants. It's important to note that the original equipment manufacturer&#39;s (OEM) two-place configuration for the bench remains unchanged, and therefore, the limitations only apply when the center position is occupied.",
    installation:
      "The STC installation involves modifying the hardware at the center seat belt attachment to accommodate the addition of a third seat belt. These hardware modifications are essential for positioning the seat belt ends to ensure proper loading into the structure. Additionally, the installation necessitates the placement of a placard on the back of the pilot seat. The entire installation process, including paperwork completion, typically requires approximately a couple of hours for an Airframe and Powerplant (A&P) mechanic with Inspection Authorization (IA).",
